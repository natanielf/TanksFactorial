# TanksFactorial

A game inspired by a minigame in Nintendo's Wii Play called Tanks!, TanksFactorial is a top-down game where 2 or more tanks battle each other in a maze-like arena.
Some key features of the game include controllable tank movements and firing, ricocheting bullets which varying velocities, and an array of maps with different layouts.
We plan to include a singleplayer and a multiplayer function, but want to focus on the multiplayer mode since it is the most fun and familiar.

Programming the game comes with many challenges, three of the biggest being the management of classes, methods, and instance variables,
using new graphics libraries to circumnavigate the issues which java's default graphics libraries pose, and creating reliable graphics, physics, and audio systems.
