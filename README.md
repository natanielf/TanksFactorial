## About

A game inspired by a minigame in [Nintendo's Wii Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Play) called [Tanks!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Play#Tanks!), TanksFactorial is a 2D top-down game where two tanks battle each other in a maze-like arena. Some key features of the game include controllable tank movements and firing, ricocheting bullets, and an experimental multiplayer mode. This game is our final project for our AP CS A course.

Programming the game comes with many challenges, three of the biggest being the management of classes, methods, and instance variables, using new graphics libraries to circumnavigate the issues which Java's default graphics libraries pose, and creating reliable graphics, physics, and audio systems.

## Running the Game

Run the `Game` class, optionally with CLI arguments to specify game parameters.

**CLI Arguments:**

- `--single` (or no args): Create a single-player game
- `--server`: Start a server on port 80 of your computer's local IP address
- `--client`: Connect to a server running at the IP address provided in another command-line argument
